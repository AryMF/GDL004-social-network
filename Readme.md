## 1. Introduction
DIYers(ˌdiːˌaɪˈwaɪɚz) is a visual social network, whose main purpose is to help users discover recipes, crafting inspiration, home hacks and more ideas to try.

## 2. Overview / Motivation
### Who uses DIYers.

DIYers is developed for crafters of all ages, people who enjoy making and sharing their own stuff and learning how to make new projects.
It allows a step trough step follow trough, so you can make the project at your own pace.

### Key Features.
* Allows login or sign up with Google, Twitter or Github.
* Allows login or sign up with email adress and password.
* Lets you edit your profile data, such as screen name, about, country and profile picture.
* You can select the topics you're interested in.
* You can share the instructions for making any of your projects with all the users, or you can decide to share a private post that only you'll be able to see.
* It includes a 'feed', which shows you the posts of the topics you're interested in.
* You can see, update and delete a post you've made.
* You can change the privacy of a post you've made.

### Motivation
DIYers was developed using MVC, SPA and Mobile Firts design as the 4th project of the Laboratoria Bootcamp in Guadalajara, Jalisco, México.
Our main motivations lays on our passion for crafting, creating and learning how to make new projects (and our love for Pinterest®, of course).
